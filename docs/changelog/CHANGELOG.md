Changelog 0.3.0 [http://keepachangelog.com/en/0.3.0/]
==============================

Introduction
-------


A change log is a file which contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project.

The point of a change log is to make it easier for users and contributors to see precisely what notable changes have been made between each release (or version) of the project.

A good change log sticks to these principles:
-------

 * It’s made for humans, not machines, so legibility is crucial.
 * Easy to link to any section (hence Markdown over plain text).
 * One sub-section per version.
 * List releases in reverse-chronological order (newest on top).
 * Write all dates in YYYY-MM-DD format. (Example: 2012-06-02 for June 2nd, 2012.) It’s international, sensible, and language-independent.
 * Explicitly mention whether the project follows Semantic Versioning.
 * Each version should:
   * List its release date in the above format.
   * Group changes to describe their impact on the project, as follows:
     * **FEATURE** for new features.
     * **ENHANCED** for changes in existing functionality.
     * **FIXED** for any bug fixes.
     * **SECURITY** to invite users to upgrade in case of vulnerabilities.
     * **REMOVED** for deprecated features removed in this release.
     * **DEPRECATED** for once-stable features removed in upcoming releases.
 * Always have an "UNRELEASED" section at the top for keeping track of any changes. This serves two purposes:
   *  People can see what changes they might expect in upcoming releases
   *  At release time, you just have to change "Unreleased" to the version number and add a new "Unreleased" header at the top.
 * Always inform about the "BREAKING CHANGES" for keeping track of any changes.
 * List of Files Revised
