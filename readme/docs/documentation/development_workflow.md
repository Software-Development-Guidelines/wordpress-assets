# Development Workflow

These are our branches:

 * **master** is our stable branch, and youâ€™ll find it running on Pressbooks.com (and reflected in our latest release).
 * **dev** is a general-purpose work-in-progress branch. It is merged with master when a new release is forthcoming.
 * **hotfix** is for emergency patches. It exists solely to avoid conflicts with dev.
 * Any other branches you find are for feature development prior to merging into dev. Use at your own risk.
 * **Tags** represent releases, but if you are downloading a release for installation, you should download the package from releases as opposed to the source code.
