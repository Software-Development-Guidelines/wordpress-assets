### WordPress can host your plugin

You’ve got a cool new plugin and are hoping to give it some exposure. You’re in the right place. Just [ask us to host it for you](https://wordpress.org/plugins/add/). You’ll be able to:

1. Keep track of how many people have downloaded it.
1. Let people leave comments about your plugin.
1. Get your plugin rated against all the other cool WordPress plugins.
1. Give your plugin lots of exposure in this centralized repository.

#### There are only a few restrictions

1. Your plugin must be compatible with the [GNU General Public License v2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html), or any later version. We strongly recommend using the same license as WordPress — “GPLv2 or later.”
1. The plugin must not do anything illegal, or be morally offensive (that’s subjective, we know).
1. You have to actually use the [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) repository we give you in order for your plugin to show up on this site. The WordPress Plugins Directory is a hosting site, not a listing site.
1. The plugin must not embed external links on the public site (like a "powered by" link) without explicitly asking the user's permission.
1. If you don’t specify a compatible license, what you check in is considered GPLv2 or later.
1. We also have a large list of [detailed guidelines](https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/guidelines/), but mostly they say how not to be a spammer.

#### It’s pretty simple

1. [Sign up](https://wordpress.org/plugins/add/).
1. Within some vaguely defined amount of time, your plugin will be manually reviewed. You may be emailed and asked to provide more information.
1. Once approved, you’ll then have access to a [Subversion Repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/svn/) where you’ll store your plugin.
1. Once you put your plugin (and a readme file!) in that repository, it will shortly be automatically entered into the [plugins browser](https://wordpress.org/plugins/).
1. Check out the [FAQ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/faq/) for more information.

### Readme files

To make your entry in the plugin browser most useful, each plugin should have a readme file named readme.txt that adheres to the WordPress plugin readme file standard. You can put your readme file through the [readme validator](https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/validator/) to check it.

## For GitHub

On GitHub, if a git repository has a README file in its main (top-level) directory, the README file is automatically converted into formatted HTML and presented on the main web page of the git repository, underneath the list of files and directories in the repository. Various different file extensions can be used,[2] but there should not be more than one file named "README" at the top-level of a GitHub repository. The conversion to HTML takes account of the file extension of the file – for example, naming the README file for a GitHub repository "README.md" would cause GitHub to treat it as a GitHub-flavored Markdown file, which is also the default README file format on GitHub.

This makes using GitHub a low-effort way to create a web page for a git repository (GitHub also supports the publication of wikis and separate websites, which may be formatted however the developers want).

Because the GitHub web interface lets users edit a file in a relatively streamlined way, without manually cloning the repository and manually making a pull request, it supports wiki-style editing of the README file[3] – with approval necessary by a committer (i.e. someone who has write access to the repository) if the user is not a committer themselves.

However, within the GitHub app for Android mobile devices, the contents of README files are not shown underneath the list of files,[4] and nor are README files formatted as HTML when viewed.

    You'll notice an 'Initialize this repository with a README' option. Every GitHub project needs a README file, as this is the first place that potential users and contributors will look for information about your project. Since this file is so important, GitHub offers to create it for you automatically. Just select 'Initialize this repository…' and GitHub generates an empty README file, so all you need to do is enter some text. Normally, it makes sense to select this option, since you'll need to create a README file at some point anyway. However, creating, adding, and committing a README file manually, is a good introduction to the GitHub workflow, so this is exactly what we're going to do in this tutorial. Leave 'Initialize this repository….' blank, but just be aware that when you come to create subsequent repositories, GitHub can generate your README file for you.
    Click 'Create Repository.' You now have an empty GitHub repository, waiting patiently for your first commit.
